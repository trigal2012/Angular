angular start up steps

1. create and go to a project dir for all angular projects
	Project/angular
2. check version of node and install or upgrade if it's not 8x or 10x
	node -v
	to check all installed node versions
	nvm ls
	to change to another node version
	nvm use node-version-here
3. install angular cli if it's not already installed
	npm install -g @angular/cli
4. create and got a project folder for this new project using node
	//to get started just go with the default answers for routing and CSS
	ng new appNameHere 
	cd appNameHere
5. build the new app and start the included node server
	//this starts the server to be able to host your app base page
	//then opens a browser to localhost:4200
	//note - if the node server is already running, you may need to kill 
	//it to run another one on the same port number
	ng serve --open

	//to kill the process, after exiting with Ctrl+Z
	pkill -9 ng
	//but it's better to stop ng server this way
	Ctrl+C
